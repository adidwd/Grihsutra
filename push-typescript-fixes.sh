git commit -m "Fix TypeScript compilation errors and GitHub Actions permissions

TypeScript Fixes:
- Fixed admin dashboard API request calls to use proper apiRequest signature
- Added proper type casting for Product arrays in admin dashboard
- Fixed SecurityStatus interface type issues
- Resolved all compilation errors in admin-dashboard.tsx
- Fixed admin login API request calls and response handling
- Updated apiRequest calls to use correct method signature

GitHub Actions Fixes:
- Added proper permissions to all workflow files (security.yml, ci-cd.yml, ci.yml)
- Created basic-ci.yml for simple builds without special permissions
- Fixed 'Resource not accessible by integration' error

Note: server/vite.ts has a minor type warning but cannot be edited due to system restrictions.
The application runs successfully and the warning does not affect functionality.

All CI/CD pipelines should now run successfully without permission errors."
